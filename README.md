# Overview

The Steam Sale Predictor is a machine learning project that forecasts whether a video game on Steam will go on sale based on its metadata.
By analyzing game attributes such as player activity, pricing, publisher behavior, and release timing, the model aims to identify trends that influence discount likelihood.

This tool can benefit both players (to anticipate discounts and save money) and publishers (to better plan sale events and reduce competition).
